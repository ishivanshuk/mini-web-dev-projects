            <p>
              
             There are a number of birds in Ireland whose numbers are in decline.
             Some of those with a high priority for conservation are:

            <h1>Conservation efforts</h1>
          <p>
           Various kinds of work are carried out in Ireland in order to protect bird species.
          </p>  
          
          <section class="stylishBox someSpacing">
            <h2>Research and monitoring</h2>
            <p>
              An essential part of bird conservation is monitoring and recording 
              information about the species such as their numbers, breeding habits, etc. 
          
            </p>
            <p>
              Scientific research may be carried out to determine whether a species is 
              in decline and how to address the problem.

          <section class="stylishBox someSpacing">
            <h2>Habitat protection</h2>
            <p>
              The destruction of habitat is a serious threat to many birds and 
              therefore protecting habitats is crucial to protecting the species.
            </p>
            
            <p>One example of this is the preservation of wetlands in Ireland.</p>

          <section class="stylishBox someSpacing">
            <h2>Control invasive plants and animals</h2>
            <p>
              Mink and rats are a predator that threaten many bird species, 
              for example by eating their eggs.
            </p>
            <p>
              Rhododendron is an example of an invasive plant which can very quickly
              take over large areas of countryside, disrupting the biodiversity.
